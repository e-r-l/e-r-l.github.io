    <h3 id="B1">The Creation</h3>
    <p>The underworld was created many years ago by a man named DreamXD, he loved to play with humans in fact his favorite hobby was manipulation of the people. DreamXD; often refered to as XD; often got carried away with his fun and ended up killing the people which meant to him that somewhere needed to be created for them to go when he was done with them, thus he made the underworld. Once upon a time the underworld was a beautiful place, it was made up of insanly tall redd brick walls and sleek black floors. There were lush forests all around the underworld.</p>

    <h3 id="B2">The Distruction</h3>
    <p> The Distruction of the beautiful underworld occured when XD had dicided he was done with a certain person who goes by the name Rina. Rina has a very specific taste in the style of building they live in. Rina quickly got tired of the underworld because of thier dislike for the look of the place, Rina was friends with the man of distruction Toby and Toby had been creating Nuclear bombs in the underworld for around 5 years at that point. Rina and Toby decided that to prove a point to XD (not just about the stlye but about the treatment of them aswell) so they planed the bombs, and as bombs do they blew the place up. On november 16th 1869 the underworld was reduced to craters and fire</p>

    <h3 id="B3">The Treatment</h3>
    <p> Even after XD claimed to be done with these people he never truly let up on his manipulative tendencies. Anyone who mande it to the underworld was subjected to the constant threats from XD himself and his newest hobbies, due to the vast amount of "hobbies" XD had the people in the underworld rarely had a moment of silence.</p>

    <h3 id="B4">The Aftermath</h3>
    <p>XD did not react well to Rina and Toby blowing up the underworld he instead reacted with more distruction. XD was angry, XD was so angry he got his own bombs (he is a god afterall) and blew up the underworld until it became less then half the size it was before. Along with the land being destroyed he killed every single person that was once a past hobbie of his. XD destroyed his own creation due to anger. </p>

    <p>Although everything that was there before was gone people were still sent down to the underworld to live in and through the aftermath of that fateful day on november 16th.</p>
